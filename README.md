Invisible Technical Question

*The Javascript code I wrote is in "Inv_Tech_Question.js". To run it on your own machine, follow the instructions below.*


INSTRUCTIONS:
1: Change the PATH of the "newfile" const on line 14 to the path where you have latinmap.js stored on your computer.
2: To run program on the command line: $ node Inv_Tech_Question.js -c 1.
3: If you want to run the program with a different test array, change the last number above. I have 5 test arrays.


IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR OWN ARRAY OF INPUTS:
1: To run the program with your own test array, create an array of postal codes and city names. Then, run the function, array_of_citys_or_postalcodes(array), and put your array in the argument.
